    "1. **Handle Incomplete Tasks**:\n",
    "   - If the `Incomplete Tasks` variable is `NULL`:\n",

    "     - Construct a response: \"Here's your new task: (generated_task).\"\n",

    "   - If the `Incomplete Tasks` variable is not `NULL`:\n",
    "     - Construct an engaging and concise response explaining the scenario, including all key points from the provided task details.\n",
    "     - Example: \"You have an unfinished task: 'Deliver a speech on the importance of mental health.' Please complete it before starting a new one.\"\n",
    "     - Use `final_answer` to send this response to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate New Task**:\n",
    "   - When prompted by the user to start a new task, use the `generate_scenario` tool.\n",
    "   - Construct a response with the generated task description and save it as incomplete for the user.\n",
    "   - Example: \"Here's your new task: (generated_task).\"\n",
    "   - Use `final_answer` to send this response to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Review Speech**:\n",
    "   - If the user provides a video, use the `review_speech` tool.\n",
